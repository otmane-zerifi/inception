# Inception

> A system administration and Docker project from the 42 Network.

## üìö Project Overview

**Inception** is a project from the 42 curriculum that introduces students to system administration using **Docker**. The goal is to set up a fully functional LEMP (Linux, Nginx, MariaDB, PHP) stack using Docker containers, along with services like WordPress and phpMyAdmin, while ensuring containerization best practices.

## üèóÔ∏è Objectives

- Use Docker to containerize multiple services.
- Deploy WordPress with MariaDB.
- Configure Nginx with SSL using self-signed certificates.
- Add optional services like Redis, Adminer, Portainer, etc.
- Set up a Makefile to automate builds.
- Use Docker Compose for orchestration.

## üß± Services

| Service      | Description                              |

| Nginx        | Web server with SSL configuration        |
| WordPress    | CMS served over PHP and Nginx            |
| MariaDB      | MySQL-compatible database for WordPress  |
| phpMyAdmin   | DB management UI (optional)              |
| Redis        | Caching layer for WordPress (optional)   |
| Portainer    | Docker management UI (optional)          |
